My dotfiles, currently using gnu stow, might write a script at some point.

Notes:
- run mkdir ~/.config before running stow .
- clone antidote into .config/zsh to get plugins working
- final lines of .zshenv need to be removed depending on software
- on debian, need to replace bat with batcat in .zshrc for the pager and the fzf-preview.
